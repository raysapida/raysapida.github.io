<div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started learning about coding, I was reading through Zed Shaw&rsquo;s
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">book</a> about Python. The very first program I
made was based on the text game in one of the <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex31.html">exercises</a>. It was
a game that would give me suggestions or try to motivate me in some way based on
how I answered questions. It was a really bad example of programming with
many nested <code>if..else</code> statements, but I believe that working through that game
was ultimately the reason why I kept trying to learn. Unfortunately, I lost that
game when my computer was stolen. Which brings me to the first thing I should
have gotten when I started, a way to backup my files.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> is the most popular
choice from but I was always afraid to show really bad code or
accidently sharing something personal like passwords or api keys. That&rsquo;s the reason that I
put off starting one for a long time. I became more diligent about backups after losing all the tutorial applications
and links that I was saving. Around that time, I created an account at <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> because it allowed free
private repositories and it helped me get started using <a href="http://gitref.org/">git</a>
commands. Starting with Github first would have helped me get over the hump about
sharing or talking with other programmers but if that barrier is too big at the
moment, it&rsquo;s better to go with the alternative than not at all.</p>

<p>Another thing I should have started from the beginning was working through an
app from <code>rails new appname</code> to deploying it. I put off this part for awhile
and it was a huge detriment later on. Personally, my fear of
deploying a demo was similar to my fear of the command line in the
beginning. A major part of that was connecting and using a Database that wasn&rsquo;t
<a href="https://sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> along with the other configurations.
I knew enough about SQL and databases in general
to work with it in a Rails app but that was different from having
to configure it outside a development environment. For demos and trying to deploy the first time, <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a>
is my number one choice because it was the most painless for me, the most that I
had to do was extract out some keys to environment variables and add a
different Ruby server besides WEBrick. Their articles
guided me on how to deploy for the first time and the reasons why they require
programs to be deployed in that way.</p>

<p>The last thing I focused on in the beginning was that I put a lot of time doing
exercises like <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">ruby koans</a> and <a href="http://exercism.io/">exercism</a>
because it abstracted out a lot of parts that I couldn&rsquo;t get my head around yet.
I only found these exercises through GitHub and in the latter&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s the
only way to access the exercises and let other users comment on your work.
I was ignorant to the design patterns other people were using since I was so
focused on just making the tests pass, but I used them to become familiar with the
syntax and the way Ruby solved problems. Aiming to work on one problem a day was
an attainable enough goal to create a habit and eventually fall in love with the
process. As an added benefit, those exercises
gave me a great appreciation of testing in general because that was the only way
I knew if I was doing the right things.</p>
