  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most difficult things for me was keeping up my motivation while learning how
to code. My biggest solution to this was something I learned from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/1455892823">The 7 Habits
of Highly Effective
People</a>
and that was a four quadrant chart separated into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Important but not Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important but Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and not Urgent</li>
</ul>


<p>I used to write this chart every day as a way to manage my time but I focus on
the first two now and created two todo lists. The important and urgent category is always the
priority but I further split the last one into easy wins and hard wins because
those are the challenges you can be flexible with it.</p>

<p>One of
the things a lot of people have suggested is taking a deep dive into
programming, program 10 hours straight per day to quickly reach the 10,000 hours for mastery
mentioned in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Outliers</a>.
That mindset disregards burnout and that is especially discouraging for a beginner.
It&rsquo;s one of those cases where the process is much more important than the goal
because of how overwhelming programming can be; there are a lot of things to
learn, it&rsquo;s important to be able to decide what abstractions are ok to work with
as is and what topics are uncomfortable enough to stretch your abilities
without breaking your motivations. Easy wins and hard wins is a way I manage
that. I focus on harder problems but I would do something from the easy category when I
knew that I needed a little break but also stay productive. It&rsquo;s very important
though to make sure that everything in that category is still important to
make sure that it&rsquo;s not another form of procrastination.</p>

<h2>Example grouping for the categories</h2>

<p>For me, the important and urgent category was filled with services I&rsquo;m paying
for which included Treehouse, Codeschool, Upcase, and any other online
subscription or working on an app I can show as a code sample in the future. The important but not urgent category
had two subclasses. The easy wins includes learning a single command, an easy
code kata/exercise, or reading a chapter for a programming book. The hard wins
include reading source code to figure out how a method works, learning a
design pattern, or learning a new tool like a text editor or tmux.</p>

<h2>Commands I learned recently</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config editor</code>
The default editor for my laptop was nano and I wanted to switch to vim.</p></li>
<li><p>When I was working on Windows 8 and Vagrant, I used a <a href="https://windows.github.com/">program</a>
that GitHub provided. I knew a handful of commands
but I&rsquo;m trying to learn enough so that I won&rsquo;t depend on the GUI.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git branch -a</code>
This list all the branches for a git repo.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git branch -d branch_to_delete</code>
This deletes a branch.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git remote add origin remote repository_URL</code>
This adds a remote repository I can push and pull to.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git blame directory/to/file.rb</code>
I learned this from Justin Weiss&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.justinweiss.com/blog/2015/03/24/go-beyond-the-easy-fix-with-code-archaeology/">blog
post</a>
and it&rsquo;s been useful to track down changes in git&rsquo;s history.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was browsing through Netflix trying to find something to fill the
room with white noise while I studied when I decided on Fantasia. At one point during the movie, the
conductor turns towards the audience to explain the concept behind one of the
pieces; Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice. An apprentice tried to use magic that he
couldn&rsquo;t control and wasn&rsquo;t stopped until his master came to fix the situation.
I think programming has a lot of these situations and the scariest mistake for
me is deployment.</p>

<p>Even little tests apps scare me because of the possibility that I&rsquo;m sharing api
keys or passwords. Right now, the only key I&rsquo;m using that shouldn&rsquo;t be in the
repository is the <code>SECRET_KEY_BASE</code> generated by <code>rake secret</code>. I&rsquo;m currently
learning about the use of <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv">dotenv</a> which
extracts the key into a <code>.env</code> file and substitutes an environment variable in
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_1_release_notes.html#config-secrets-yml">config/secrets.yml</a>.
Before this method, I wouldn&rsquo;t commit the <code>secrets.yml</code> into the repository.</p>

<p>With a particular <a href="https://github.com/raysapida/mustached-octo-robot">app</a>, I was
having problems with deploying it after I updated the gems. I incrementally
updated Rails and Ruby versions making sure that all the tests pass. Because
of this process, I was sure that the problem involves the database or
gem/feature I added but didn&rsquo;t test. The app was hosted on heroku and the first
thing I did was look at the log by running <code>heroku logs --tail</code>. I wasn&rsquo;t sure
what the error message was saying so my first instinct was to reproduce the situation on my
computer.</p>

<p>Before this, I was using vagrant to configure my environment and the Vagrantfile
was configuring the database for me. Now that I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="http://ubuntugnome.org/">Ubuntu Gnome</a>
on my computer, I needed to create a Postgres database for a local
development environment along with an associated user. After <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-14-04">installing Postgres</a>,
I created a database and  an associated user for the app.</p>

<h2>Postgres commands I needed to use: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19953653/how-to-set-up-postgres-database-for-local-rails-project">Stackoverflow link</a></h2>

<p><code>create user username with password 'password';</code></p>

<p><code>alter user username superuser;</code></p>

<p><code>create database projectname_development;</code></p>

<p><code>grant all privileges on database projectname_development to username;</code></p>

<h2>Fixing the problem</h2>

<p>After going through these steps and connecting Postgres with the development
environment by editing the <code>database.yml</code> file, I found the same error recorded
at the heroku logs. The error message was saying that it was using a Ruby version 2.2.0 when I was
using 2.2.1 and that there was a problem parsing the yaml file of the Jekyll
blog. I was able to fix it on my computer by resetting rvm and making sure it
was using the correct Ruby version, but I didn&rsquo;t know how to do the same thing for
heroku. Based on the messages during deployment, the problem seems like it
originates from my <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file. I originally started working on the app in
a Windows environment, migrating it to a virtual machine through Vagrant, and
then to an Ubuntu laptop now. Heroku had to redo <code>bundle install</code> after each
deployment because of the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t use the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file due to the
Windows line endings.</p>

<p>I deleted that file and reran
<code>bundle install</code>. Also, since the <a href="https://github.com/zbruhnke/bloggy">bloggy gem</a>
was throwing the error and I was already planning to remove it in the future, I decided
to uninstall it as well. I&rsquo;m aiming to add a different blogging engine or a basic
Rails one so that the layouts would not be separate from the Rails app. This way,
I would be able to write unit tests for it in the future. Jekyll is a static site generator and I
don&rsquo;t know how to create a proper test for it besides making sure that
<code>jekyll build</code> wasn&rsquo;t throwing any errors. Afterwards,
<code>heroku run rake db:migrate</code> was successful and the app was running again.</p>

technically simple, the host was saying most of the problem was dealing with
that guilt and leading them to a place where they could program again.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started learning about coding, I was reading through Zed Shaw&rsquo;s
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">book</a> about Python. The very first program I
made was based on the text game in one of the <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex31.html">exercises</a>. It was
a game that would give me suggestions or try to motivate me in some way based on
how I answered questions. It was a really bad example of programming with
many nested <code>if..else</code> statements, but I believe that working through that game
was ultimately the reason why I kept trying to learn. Unfortunately, I lost that
game when my computer was stolen. Which brings me to the first thing I should
have gotten when I started, a way to backup my files.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> is the most popular
choice from but I was always afraid to show really bad code or
accidently sharing something personal like passwords or api keys. That&rsquo;s the reason that I
put off starting one for a long time. I became more diligent about backups after losing all the tutorial applications
and links that I was saving. Around that time, I created an account at <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> because it allowed free
private repositories and it helped me get started using <a href="http://gitref.org/">git</a>
commands. Starting with Github first would have helped me get over the hump about
sharing or talking with other programmers but if that barrier is too big at the
moment, it&rsquo;s better to go with the alternative than not at all.</p>

<p>Another thing I should have started from the beginning was working through an
app from <code>rails new appname</code> to deploying it. I put off this part for awhile
and it was a huge detriment later on. Personally, my fear of
deploying a demo was similar to my fear of the command line in the
beginning. A major part of that was connecting and using a Database that wasn&rsquo;t
<a href="https://sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> along with the other configurations.
I knew enough about SQL and databases in general
to work with it in a Rails app but that was different from having
to configure it outside a development environment. For demos and trying to deploy the first time, <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a>
is my number one choice because it was the most painless for me, the most that I
had to do was extract out some keys to environment variables and add a
different Ruby server besides WEBrick. Their articles
guided me on how to deploy for the first time and the reasons why they require
programs to be deployed in that way.</p>

<p>The last thing I focused on in the beginning was that I put a lot of time doing
exercises like <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">ruby koans</a> and <a href="http://exercism.io/">exercism</a>
because it abstracted out a lot of parts that I couldn&rsquo;t get my head around yet.
I only found these exercises through GitHub and in the latter&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s the
only way to access the exercises and let other users comment on your work.
I was ignorant to the design patterns other people were using since I was so
focused on just making the tests pass, but I used them to become familiar with the
syntax and the way Ruby solved problems. Aiming to work on one problem a day was
an attainable enough goal to create a habit and eventually fall in love with the
process. As an added benefit, those exercises
gave me a great appreciation of testing in general because that was the only way
I knew if I was doing the right things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been taking an <a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/">email course</a> by
<a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com">John Somez</a> on blogging and it has been a great
way to refocus on the possible content for this site. One of the first suggestions I
ever heard about learning how to program was that I should blog as much as possible, but
I kept struggling with deciding what I should write about and being consistent with it.</p>

<h2>Choosing a theme</h2>

<p>When I started exploring web development and programming, there were so many choices and
possible paths that I became hesitant and afraid to make the wrong decision. I tried a
little bit of everything because of that fear. I would try all the beginner courses on Treehouse
covering JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Ruby when I should have stuck with one.
Choosing a theme reminded me of that indecisiveness. It eventually came down to
writing about something I&rsquo;m familiar with (Ruby on Rails) or something that I need to learn more about (JavaScript frameworks).
I eventually decided to write about Ruby because its the topic I&rsquo;m most
confident in and a language I really enjoy using. I also believe that there is a big jump between
introductory tutorials on Rails and intermediate level stuff that I could help
fill with my blog posts. If I&rsquo;m able to, I want to incorporate a magic theme because
I always hear about the magic that goes in the background of a Rails
application. One of my favorite Ruby books, called Metaprogramming Ruby 2,
had a section called spell book that prompted me to record and study design patterns or quirky
Ruby behavior in notebooks as if I was writing my own Ruby spellbooks. While
learning on my own, little motivations like that can sometimes help the most and
it&rsquo;s a fun way to think about programming.</p>

<h2>Creating the blog</h2>

<p>I had already created this blog by forking a pre-made <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">jekyll
repo</a>, following its instructions
and reading an <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">article</a> on setting it up.
I was able to host it on my account&rsquo;s <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github page</a>
and the repo itself included plugins for disqus and most common social media accounts.
I read a blog post about the <a href="http://www.digital-results.com/static-site-generators/">advantages</a>
of a static site generators and since <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> was written in Ruby, I was more inclined
to use it as a blogging platform instead of Wordpress. I&rsquo;m aiming to improve the
styling for this blog in the future or even migrate it to a <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> project since that one more
closely resembles a Rails app.</p>

<h2>Blog post ideas</h2>

<p>When I was struggling to come up with blog post ideas
before this course, I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think of sitting down and brainstorming 30 to 50 ideas at once. It
seems obvious now and I can definitely see it helping in a lot of ways.
I can start writing drafts days before I need to publish them or
even create drafts for other posts. This will enable me to check my work and
add more relevant details that come up after multiple proofreadings. This reduces the fear
I have with putting my writing out there and would encourage more creative ideas. Also, I
came up with a lot of things I wish I knew when I started and those
are the blog posts I want to write first.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>Consistency might be the most difficult part of writing a blog. Staying consistent and
forming good habits is very important because if I can&rsquo;t be disciplined enough to write
regularly, why should the readers care about following my posts? I want to
publish as much as I can to show and share how much I&rsquo;ve learned, become better
as a writer, and get called out if I don&rsquo;t fully understand what I&rsquo;m
talking about. In a way, writing without comments or feedback is like coding
without tests, you won&rsquo;t really know if what you&rsquo;re doing is wrong until a bigger problem
occurs down the road.</p>

<h2>Web traffic</h2>

<p>This is another tough one. There are so many blogs out there and standing out
will take a lot of time and effort. It involves following other
people&rsquo;s blogs, commenting with relevant information, and providing value in
some way. I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to engage with the comments section for blogs
that I follow and trusting myself enough to voice an opinion, but everything is
always a work in progress. Writing more blog posts would probably help in that
department too.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/ls.html">ls</a> command list the contents of the current directory. A more detailed
  form would be <code>ls -la</code> which lists the contents along with their file permissions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/cd.html">cd</a> command lets you move back and forth from folders by adding the
  folder name afterwards. <code>cd ..</code> lets you move back by one folder and <code>cd -</code>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/mkdir.html">mkdir</a> command makes a folder while <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/rmdir.html">rmdir</a> removes an empty folder.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/cp.html">cp</a> can copy files where the the first group is the target and the second
  group is the destination.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/mv.html">mv</a> moves files and works similarly to <code>cp</code> except the first group is
  deleted afterwards.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/rm.html">rm</a> command deletes a file and passing in additional flags like <code>rm
  -rf</code> would delete a whole folder along with its contents.</p>

<h2>Useful Commands</h2>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/man.html">man</a> followed by another command would show the complete help
  section on how to use that command. Whenever I&rsquo;m lost or forgot how to use a
particular command, I would use this to figure out how it works.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/sudo.html">sudo</a> can be prepended to other commands that need super user
  permission to execute.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/chmod.html">chmod</a> can change the file permissions of a file enabling you to edit or use
  thE FIle.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/grep.html">grep</a> lets you search through the file&rsquo;s or output&rsquo;s contents using a regular
  expression. There are other commands that other people use to perform the same
function but this is the most common one.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/head.html">head</a> and <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/tail.html">tail</a> - Shows the first of last ten lines for a file or output.
  They&rsquo;re useful for logs and when piping a string of commands.</p>

<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html">rails</a> has their own set of
  commands along with
<a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#running-migrations">rake</a> commands for migrations. I end up using <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-console">rails
console</a> the most
when debugging a problem or exploring an application.</p>

<h2>Optional Commands</h2>

<p><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/up.html">vagrant up</a> and <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/ssh.html">vagrant ssh</a> - I had a lot of trouble with setting up a development environment since I had a Windows 8 laptop. I
learned that <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> was the easiest way to start
using a virtual machine at the time and I started with the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box">rails dev box</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/cli">rvm</a> was how I managed my environments and it helped
  me separate incompatible gems. A Gemfile should manage most of
these but I had trouble figuring out where errors were coming from when
installing gems and this was an easier solution at the time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html">vim</a> - I started with vim because I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to share
  folders between the virtual machine and the local machine but I ended up
enjoying being able to quickly switch between the editor and shell so much that I stuck
with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course">tmux</a> - I began learning this on an Upcase trail and using it finally
  convinced me to install a Linux distribution. It became more evident that developing in a virtual
machine was the bottleneck for me when I became comfortable
enough in a tmux session, especially when running tests.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was getting deeper into reading <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The Rspec
Book</a> a few weeks ago, I found
that I had difficulties when it came to information that wasn&rsquo;t included in the
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">rails guides</a>. I picked up <a href="https://leanpub.com/tr4w">The Rails 4
Way</a> to rectify that. The book felt more like
documentation while I was reading it and that&rsquo;s very intentional. The breadth and
depth was impressive and I wanted to get a book that I could carry with me as a
physical documentation of the framework. I knew before reading it that I
couldn&rsquo;t memorize everything the book had to offer so I read it like I would
when I read Google Map directions, finding the general routes I needed and
making a mental note for things that I didn&rsquo;t need to know now but would
definitely look into once I reached that landmark.</p>

<p>The first chapter dealt with a rails environment and configuration. Most of it
dealt with things I learned from other sources but I was introduced into the
specifics of bundler and other configuration details. This is the section I
learned to add gems into the vendor directory which I wanted to do because I
recently learned about ctags from Upcase&rsquo;s vim trail. This enabled me to jump
around my app figuring out how methods are called throughout the application.
The next three chapters after that were also refreshers on routes, REST in
Rails, and controllers.</p>

<p>There were five full chapters that dealt with active record split into general
active record uses, migrations, associations, validations and advance active
record uses. Active record deals with so many parts of Rails that I remember looking at the
source code before and not getting where to begin. The book delved into the
database adapters for the most common relational databases and how Rails
interprets the types of data they use. During the rest of the chapters, what
stood out to me the most where how callback were used in the model, how
associations are made particularly polymorphic associations, and using indexes.</p>

<p>The tenth chapter dealt with the action view part of Rails and introduced the
decent exposure gem. Most of it was a refresher dealing with methods available
in the view diretory, using partials, and rendering objects or collections. The
most useful part I learned was the <code>assigns</code> instance variable which shows what
is being communicated between the controller and view.</p>
