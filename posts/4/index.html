  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was getting deeper into reading <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The Rspec
Book</a> a few weeks ago, I found
that I had difficulties when it came to information that wasn&rsquo;t included in the
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">rails guides</a>. I picked up <a href="https://leanpub.com/tr4w">The Rails 4
Way</a> to rectify that. The book felt more like
documentation while I was reading it and that&rsquo;s very intentional. The breadth and
depth was impressive and I wanted to get a book that I could carry with me as a
physical documentation of the framework. I knew before reading it that I
couldn&rsquo;t memorize everything the book had to offer so I read it like I would
when I read Google Map directions, finding the general routes I needed and
making a mental note for things that I didn&rsquo;t need to know now but would
definitely look into once I reached that landmark.</p>

<p>The first chapter dealt with a rails environment and configuration. Most of it
dealt with things I learned from other sources but I was introduced into the
specifics of bundler and other configuration details. This is the section I
learned to add gems into the vendor directory which I wanted to do because I
recently learned about ctags from Upcase&rsquo;s vim trail. This enabled me to jump
around my app figuring out how methods are called throughout the application.
The next three chapters after that were also refreshers on routes, REST in
Rails, and controllers.</p>

<p>There were five full chapters that dealt with active record split into general
active record uses, migrations, associations, validations and advance active
record uses. Active record deals with so many parts of Rails that I remember looking at the
source code before and not getting where to begin. The book delved into the
database adapters for the most common relational databases and how Rails
interprets the types of data they use. During the rest of the chapters, what
stood out to me the most where how callback were used in the model, how
associations are made particularly polymorphic associations, and using indexes.</p>

<p>The tenth chapter dealt with the action view part of Rails and introduced the
decent exposure gem. Most of it was a refresher dealing with methods available
in the view diretory, using partials, and rendering objects or collections. The
most useful part I learned was the <code>assigns</code> instance variable which shows what
is being communicated between the controller and view.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working through the testing trails in upcase for test doubles and
testing fundamentals. The most difficult part for me was understanding mocks and spies along with how to
structure them to make sure the right behavior is being tested. I&rsquo;ve
written unit tests and a few acceptance tests in the past but I&rsquo;ve never used
test doubles before the upcase trail. I had to research the differences between
fakes, dummies, stubs, spies and mocks. Upcase provided an
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">aricle</a> by Martin Fowler as
an introduction to those ideas. From my understanding, the advantages
of using test doubles are clarity and speed. The unit tests should already tests
that the proper answers are being given in the model or controller level which
makes stubs a good way to improve them. Mocks ensure that specific method calls
are being used and spies take that a step further by recording how the method
calls are used. For example, spies could say that a method call was used twice
instead of the expected once.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned the definitions for different kinds of testing; unit,
integration, feature, and functional tests. Unit tests are for a small subset of the
application and I closely associate it with tests for a specific controller or
model. Integration tests go from end to end and I&rsquo;ve used it to test that
logging in to an application or using the user interface. Functional tests are
integration tests that actually run the application from end to end similar to
making sure that an email is sent when a person is trying to recover a forgotten
password. Feature tests are for things that change the functionality of the
application like changing a status update from text only to including image
attachments.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also still getting used to rspec and capybara. The most prevalent comments I would receive from the
exercises were the different shortcuts people use in their tests and other
improvements on readability to make sure that the reader can better understand
the intent behind the tests. Most of my
tests in the past was using Minitest because it was included by default and
it was the framework most of the tutorials I followed use; it&rsquo;s the testing framework included with the exercism
exercises and the Treehouse tutorials for the Treebook application. I&rsquo;ve never
really thought of tests outside unit testing but I&rsquo;m appreciating what testing
adds to the application. I&rsquo;m starting to see why tests can function as
documentation instead of comments and how bugs can be recreated to better
understand where edge cases are coming from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent most of January working on exercism challenges and refamiliarizing myself with Rails. I haven&rsquo;t been able to pair program with other people yet and online
exercises have been the only way I&rsquo;ve gotten feedback for the programs I&rsquo;ve written. It&rsquo;s been a good way to learn more about design patterns and subtleties in the Ruby language. Out of all the exercises there, I enjoyed the one about Binary Search Trees the most. Another user on the site turned me towards using the Null Object Pattern and my research into the topic led me to an <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/05/30/null-objects-and-falsiness/">article</a> that illustrated how it could be used in Ruby. In the end, I ended up with code that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Bst
  attr_accessor :left, :right, :data

  def initialize(data)
    @data = data
    @left = NullObject.new
    @right = NullObject.new
  end

  def insert(number)
    if number &gt; @data
      in_right(number)
    elsif number &lt;= @data
      in_left(number)
    end
  end

  def each(&amp;block)
    left.each(&amp;block)
    block.call(data)
    right.each(&amp;block)
  end

  private

  def in_right(number)
    right.insert(number) or @right = Bst.new(number)
  end

  def in_left(number)
    left.insert(number) or @left = Bst.new(number)
  end
end
class NullObject
  def data
    nil
  end

  def insert(*)
    false
  end

  def each(*)
    self
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The exercism website also had challenges that involved other data structures
like linked lists and matrices. I&rsquo;ve been reading more and more about how to
become job ready as a programmer and there have been a lot of advice on being
familiar with common data structures and how to implement them as well as
recognizing the <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">Big-O</a> complexities of different algorithms. I&rsquo;ve mostly been teaching
myself and I know that I need to spend time on subjects that other programmers
would have been exposed to in school. I want to do my best to expose my
ignorance now.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve also started a membership at <a href="upcase.com">upcase</a> so that I could become
more familiar with the tools that Ruby on Rails developers use. I&rsquo;ve learned
more about how to use vim and testing use rspec/capybara. I&rsquo;m amazed by how
efficient I could be using while vim and how easy it could be to learn when I&rsquo;m
pointed in the right direction. I&rsquo;ve neglected how to write my own tests in the
past and I&rsquo;m trying to remedy that by learning how to use the tools other
developers employ. Currently, I&rsquo;m also trying to learn how to use tmux in one of
upcase&rsquo;s new trails.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started learning more and more about Rails, I became very aware that my programming skills in Ruby was lacking. I would read the code examples and I would find many methods and concepts that I repeatedly had to look up online in order to understand. I started to panic a little bit then because I was afraid that what I was doing wasn&rsquo;t working and that I wasn&rsquo;t internalizing what I was learning.  A lot of times I feel like I&rsquo;m fumbling around trying to find a way to reach out and find something to hold on to and effectively learn. The main way I&rsquo;ve been doing this is through code challenges and tutorials but I&rsquo;ve been finding that there is a huge gap between the code that I was writing and the code that I would read on open source projects.</p>

<p>Because of that gap, I&rsquo;ve been reading as many Ruby Books as I can. This past month, I&rsquo;ve gone through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360">Learn to Program</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692">Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-Ruby-Program-Like-Facets/dp/1941222129">Metaprogramming Ruby 2: Program Like the Ruby Pros</a> and I&rsquo;m also halfway through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104">Eloquent Ruby</a>. These four books had a lot of intersections and they were a great starting point for the techniques that I was coming across while trying to read open source code. Along with those books, I&rsquo;ve also read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X">Secrets of the Javascript Ninja</a> so that I could learn more about the Web API/DOM and how Javascript fits into that picture. A lot of the tutorials I&rsquo;ve been finding uses Javascript extensively and my lack of understanding in that subject was becoming a bigger problem.</p>

<p>Because of these issues, I decided that December was the month that I would hunker down and challenge these glaring holes in my understanding. I dove deeper into Ruby and Javascript than I have before and ensured that I knew as much as I could before I buried myself even more into the various frameworks I was running across. Most of this renewed enthusiasm towards the language instead of the framework was because I was hearing over and over again about people learning frameworks without knowing what problems those frameworks were trying to solve.</p>

<p>In my head, I have a clearer picture of Ruby&rsquo;s object model and order for it&rsquo;s method lookup. I have a clearer idea of how an object inherits it&rsquo;s methods and how monkeypatching works. I&rsquo;ve learned more about the techniques Rubyist use in their code including <code>method_missing</code> and the <code>eval</code> family to create scopes or get around them. I&rsquo;ve gone through them too quickly to fully understand their importance but I&rsquo;m going to use what I&rsquo;ve learned to understand the open source projects that I&rsquo;m using.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m finally sitting down and trying to look into the questions that built up from the past week</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Why adding the ruby gem foreman into the Gemfile is not recommended?</h3>

<p>This ruby gem is used for organizing apps with multiple components and uses a Procfile. The Procfile lists which processes foreman is suppose to manage. Heroku has an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile#process-types-as-templates">article</a> that provides further details on Procfiles and the github page for foreman also has an extensive <a href="http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/">manual</a>. What jumped out the most from the foreman manual were the flags for port and concurrency which managed how many workers would be used for each process. From the heroku article , the most basic command in the Procfile was <code>bundle exec rails server -p $PORT</code> but more processes can be added. From what I can find, Heroku didn&rsquo;t suggest adding foreman into the Gemfile because its already added by default.</p></li>
<li><h3>How does Unicorn interact with Rack Applications ?</h3>

<p>I found an <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2010/everything-you-need-to-know-about-unicorn">article</a> that clarified the features that Unicorn has. There was also another article on how they can be configured at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-optimize-unicorn-workers-in-a-ruby-on-rails-app">Digitial Ocean</a>. Both articles wrote about the advantages of using Unicorn but I didn&rsquo;t start seeing how it could be implemented until I looked at the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html#loading-rails-rack-lib-rack-server-rb">guide</a> for the Rails Initialization Process. At the end of the guide, it mentioned that the process would be handed off to the specific server implementaion and that led me to the <a href="http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/tree/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb">Unicorn::HttpServer</a> class. I&rsquo;m not sure how the process goes after it reaches this point, but I&rsquo;ll read the source code more in detail to find out. I do know from the comments that a server could be run using <code>HttpServer::run</code>. In the future, I want to write a blog post that extends the guide to how Unicorn would handle the last line <code>server.run wrapped_app, options, &amp;blk</code>.</p></li>
<li><h3>What are the major differences between Unicorn, Thin , Puma and other Rack web servers ?</h3>

<p>This <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-comparison-of-rack-web-servers-for-ruby-web-applications">article</a> was a great start on figuring out the differences between the servers. The answer produced even more questions though. Specifically on what is NGINX, Mongrel&rsquo;s parser, Event Machine network I/O library, and the specifics of Rack middleware for HTTP requests.</p></li>
<li><h3>How does concurrency and thread-safe work in a Rails?</h3>

<p>I started looking at stackoverflow to find out what <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/concurrency-vs-parallelism-what-is-the-difference">concurrency</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/261683/what-is-meant-by-thread-safe-code">thread-safe</a> means. There was also another <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15184338/how-to-know-what-is-not-thread-safe-in-ruby">post</a> on what isn&rsquo;t thread safe in Ruby. Rails has a specific <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/config-threadsafe/">configuration</a> that is turned on by default and this <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/06/18/removing-config-threadsafe.html">post</a> went into through an indepth discussion about what that configuration did. The most interesting parts was when he said that &ldquo;We know that loading the framework isn’t threadsafe, so the strategy is to load it all up before any threads are ready to handle requests&rdquo; and that the <code>@allow_concurrency</code> option turns off a Rack Middleware called <code>Rack::Lock</code>. Again, this opened up more questions about the difference between multi-threaded servers and multi-process servers along with the difference between eager loading and lazy loading.</p>

<pre><code>  def threadsafe!
      @preload_frameworks = true
      @cache_classes      = true
      @dependency_loading = false
      @allow_concurrency  = true
      self
  end
</code></pre></li>
<li><h3>How to configure a deployment through environment variables?</h3>

<p>After finding two articles about it from <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html">railsapps</a> and <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/managing-environment-configuration-variables-in-rails">tealeaf</a>, the best ways I read to manage environment variables centers around two gems; <a href="https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro">figaro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv-deployment">dotenv-development</a>. Both use a separate file, <code>.env</code> and <code>application.yml</code> respectively, that can be used to set environment variables and should not added to the public repository.</p></li>
<li><h3>What are the best practices for deploying a Rails application?</h3>

<p>There were many articles about this and I found that the best practices revolve around where you&rsquo;re deploying to and the specific requirements for your app. A common thread I found was using a tool to standardize the process like <a href="http://capistranorb.com/documentation/overview/what-is-capistrano/">capistrano</a>, <a href="https://www.getchef.com/chef/">chef</a>, or <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>.</p></li>
