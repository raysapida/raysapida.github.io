  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working to rewrite the test suite for one of the apps I&rsquo;ve made from
Minitest/Fixtures to Rspec/Factory Girl. My favorite thing about Minitest is
that it&rsquo;s simple to understand since it&rsquo;s just Ruby, but I wanted to explore what
Rspec has to offer. I&rsquo;ve seen alot of
Rspec in the open source projects I&rsquo;ve looked into and in many of the tutorials
I follow. Even though the syntax is easy to understand, using it to code was
harder than I thought. I started a quick reference sheet from cheat sheats I
found on the internet and the documentation for the gems. They don&rsquo;t give a full
explanation on what they do, but I found that the syntax is expressive enough
that being able to see an example is enough to use it.</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<pre><code>describe &lt;class&gt; do
  it "description of what happens" do 
    &lt;setup code&gt;
    &lt;exercise code&gt;
    &lt;expectation code&gt;
    &lt;cleanup code&gt;
  end
end
</code></pre>

<h2>Setup code</h2>

<pre><code>before { &lt;setup code&gt; }
let( &lt;variable&gt; ) { &lt;object instantiate&gt; }

## Test doubles
book = double("book")
book = instance_double("book")
allow(book).to receive(:title).and_return("The Rspec Book")
allow_any_instance_of(Widget).to receive(:name).and_return("Wibble")
spy("invitation")
instance_spy("invitation")
class_spy("invitation")
object_spy("invitation")
</code></pre>

<h2>Exercise code</h2>

<pre><code>## Model Tests from shoulda-matchers gem documentation

it { should &lt;should-matchers code&gt; }

<h2>Thoughtbot articles on testing</h2>

TDD. I&rsquo;ve been going through a lot of the blog posts on the thoughtbot because I
started learning about Rspec in general from their Upcase trails and using many
of their tools. These are a few of the articles I&rsquo;ve read that helped me get a

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While I was experimenting with the
<a href="https://github.com/sideshowcoder/dotenv-heroku">dotenv-heroku</a> gem, the app I
was deploying started showing the app crashed error message. I ran all my tests
before pushing the code to heroku so I was sure that the problem had something
to do with the configuration.</p>

<h2>First suspect: Devise secret key</h2>

<p>Since I had just extracted the secret key for Devise into an environment
variable, I thought that the problem was because the Rails app was throwing an
error since Devise couldn&rsquo;t read the environment variable. I undid my commit
but the app still wouldn&rsquo;t start. I added
<a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo">heroku-repo</a> to see if the problem could
be fixed by rebuilding the repository with different keys for the environment variable.</p>

<h2>Second suspect: database.yml</h2>

<p>I tried to see if I could access the app from the command line. I ran <code>heroku run rails console</code>
and received the error:</p>

<ul>
<li>active_record/connection_adapters/connection_specification.rb:37:in `initialize': undefined method `tr' for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError)</li>
</ul>


<p>That led me to question if my configuration in the <code>database.yml</code> was wrong or that
the yaml file wasn&rsquo;t properly formatted. I played around with different settings
with no luck. After searching through articles and Heroku&rsquo;s
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#connecting-in-ruby">devcenter</a>, I
found out that Heroku bypasses that file and only needs the url for the
database.</p>

<h2>Third suspect: DATABASE_URL</h2>

<p>The corresponding method was:</p>

<pre><code>def initialize(url)
  raise "Database URL cannot be empty" if url.blank?
  @uri     = uri_parser.parse(url)
  @adapter = @uri.scheme.tr('-', '_')
  @adapter = "postgresql" if @adapter == "postgres"
  if @uri.opaque
    @uri.opaque, @query = @uri.opaque.split('?', 2)
  else
    @query = @uri.query
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Since the first line wasn&rsquo;t raised, the url was not blank. The method was
reading the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> variable but was having problems afterwards. Something
was happening in the next two lines. The instance variable <code>@uri</code> was calling a
method:</p>

<pre><code>def uri_parser
    @uri_parser ||= URI::Parser.new
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>URI::Parser</code> is part of a Ruby standard library that deals with a string of
characters representing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier">uniform resource
identifier</a>. The
<code>uri_parser</code> method instantiates a new URI object and the <code>parse</code> method then
tries to create a uri object from the <code>url</code> passed in. The <code>@adapter</code> tries to read
the resulting variable with the <code>scheme</code> method and that was when the <code>tr</code> method
throws an error because scheme can&rsquo;t read the object. After reading the
documention for the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.1/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/RFC2396_Parser.html#method-i-parse">parse
method</a>,
I realized that the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> variable that was set in the environment was
not properly formatted.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>At some point when I first tried to push the <code>.env</code> file to Heroku, the url
changed and the colon characters turned into equal characters. I&rsquo;m not sure
if the dotenv-heroku gem did this but I exchanged the gem for
<a href="https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-config">heroku-config</a>
instead and set the variables that way.</p>

<h2>Easier way to debug</h2>

<p>I realized later that above the initialize method was an example comment:</p>

<pre><code>    # == Example
    #
    #   url = "postgresql://foo:bar@localhost:9000/foo_test?pool=5&amp;timeout=3000"
    #   ConnectionUrlResolver.new(url).to_hash
    #   # =&gt; {
    #     "adapter"  =&gt; "postgresql",
    #     "host"     =&gt; "localhost",
    #     "port"     =&gt; 9000,
    #     "database" =&gt; "foo_test",
    #     "username" =&gt; "foo",
    #     "password" =&gt; "bar",
    #     "pool"     =&gt; "5",
    #     "timeout"  =&gt; "3000"
    #   }
</code></pre>

<p>If I read the example for the url I would have seen that the <code>DATABASE_URL</code> was
not properly formatted. I appreciate that I&rsquo;m now able to dig into Rails to figure out
what&rsquo;s wrong, but reading the error message and corresponding comments carefully could have
saved me hours of time. A lesson learned for the next time I have problems
pushing environment variables.</p>

<time class='entry-date' datetime='2015-03-25T00:00:00-07:00'><span class='date'><span class='date-month'>Mar</span> <span class='date-day'>25</span><span class='date-suffix'>th</span>, <span class='date-year'>2015</span></span> <span class='time'>12:00 am</span></time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the most difficult things for me was keeping up my motivation while learning how
to code. My biggest solution to this was something I learned from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/1455892823">The 7 Habits
of Highly Effective
People</a>
and that was a four quadrant chart separated into:</p>

<ul>
<li>Important and Urgent</li>
<li>Important but not Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important but Urgent</li>
<li>Not Important and not Urgent</li>
</ul>


<p>I used to write this chart every day as a way to manage my time but I focus on
the first two now and created two todo lists. The important and urgent category is always the
priority but I further split the last one into easy wins and hard wins because
those are the challenges you can be flexible with it.</p>

<p>One of
the things a lot of people have suggested is taking a deep dive into
programming, program 10 hours straight per day to quickly reach the 10,000 hours for mastery
mentioned in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930">Outliers</a>.
That mindset disregards burnout and that is especially discouraging for a beginner.
It&rsquo;s one of those cases where the process is much more important than the goal
because of how overwhelming programming can be; there are a lot of things to
learn, it&rsquo;s important to be able to decide what abstractions are ok to work with
as is and what topics are uncomfortable enough to stretch your abilities
without breaking your motivations. Easy wins and hard wins is a way I manage
that. I focus on harder problems but I would do something from the easy category when I
knew that I needed a little break but also stay productive. It&rsquo;s very important
though to make sure that everything in that category is still important to
make sure that it&rsquo;s not another form of procrastination.</p>

<h2>Example grouping for the categories</h2>

<p>For me, the important and urgent category was filled with services I&rsquo;m paying
for which included Treehouse, Codeschool, Upcase, and any other online
subscription or working on an app I can show as a code sample in the future. The important but not urgent category
had two subclasses. The easy wins includes learning a single command, an easy
code kata/exercise, or reading a chapter for a programming book. The hard wins
include reading source code to figure out how a method works, learning a
design pattern, or learning a new tool like a text editor or tmux.</p>

<h2>Commands I learned recently</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><code>sudo update-alternatives --config editor</code>
The default editor for my laptop was nano and I wanted to switch to vim.</p></li>
<li><p>When I was working on Windows 8 and Vagrant, I used a <a href="https://windows.github.com/">program</a>
that GitHub provided. I knew a handful of commands
but I&rsquo;m trying to learn enough so that I won&rsquo;t depend on the GUI.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git branch -a</code>
This list all the branches for a git repo.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git branch -d branch_to_delete</code>
This deletes a branch.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git remote add origin remote repository_URL</code>
This adds a remote repository I can push and pull to.</p></li>
<li><p><code>git blame directory/to/file.rb</code>
I learned this from Justin Weiss&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.justinweiss.com/blog/2015/03/24/go-beyond-the-easy-fix-with-code-archaeology/">blog
post</a>
and it&rsquo;s been useful to track down changes in git&rsquo;s history.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was browsing through Netflix trying to find something to fill the
room with white noise while I studied when I decided on Fantasia. At one point during the movie, the
conductor turns towards the audience to explain the concept behind one of the
pieces; Sorcerer&rsquo;s Apprentice. An apprentice tried to use magic that he
couldn&rsquo;t control and wasn&rsquo;t stopped until his master came to fix the situation.
I think programming has a lot of these situations and the scariest mistake for
me is deployment.</p>

<p>Even little tests apps scare me because of the possibility that I&rsquo;m sharing api
keys or passwords. Right now, the only key I&rsquo;m using that shouldn&rsquo;t be in the
repository is the <code>SECRET_KEY_BASE</code> generated by <code>rake secret</code>. I&rsquo;m currently
learning about the use of <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv">dotenv</a> which
extracts the key into a <code>.env</code> file and substitutes an environment variable in
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/4_1_release_notes.html#config-secrets-yml">config/secrets.yml</a>.
Before this method, I wouldn&rsquo;t commit the <code>secrets.yml</code> into the repository.</p>

<p>With a particular <a href="https://github.com/raysapida/mustached-octo-robot">app</a>, I was
having problems with deploying it after I updated the gems. I incrementally
updated Rails and Ruby versions making sure that all the tests pass. Because
of this process, I was sure that the problem involves the database or
gem/feature I added but didn&rsquo;t test. The app was hosted on heroku and the first
thing I did was look at the log by running <code>heroku logs --tail</code>. I wasn&rsquo;t sure
what the error message was saying so my first instinct was to reproduce the situation on my
computer.</p>

<p>Before this, I was using vagrant to configure my environment and the Vagrantfile
was configuring the database for me. Now that I&rsquo;ve installed <a href="http://ubuntugnome.org/">Ubuntu Gnome</a>
on my computer, I needed to create a Postgres database for a local
development environment along with an associated user. After <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-14-04">installing Postgres</a>,
I created a database and  an associated user for the app.</p>

<h2>Postgres commands I needed to use: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19953653/how-to-set-up-postgres-database-for-local-rails-project">Stackoverflow link</a></h2>

<p><code>create user username with password 'password';</code></p>

<p><code>alter user username superuser;</code></p>

<p><code>create database projectname_development;</code></p>

<p><code>grant all privileges on database projectname_development to username;</code></p>

<h2>Fixing the problem</h2>

<p>After going through these steps and connecting Postgres with the development
environment by editing the <code>database.yml</code> file, I found the same error recorded
at the heroku logs. The error message was saying that it was using a Ruby version 2.2.0 when I was
using 2.2.1 and that there was a problem parsing the yaml file of the Jekyll
blog. I was able to fix it on my computer by resetting rvm and making sure it
was using the correct Ruby version, but I didn&rsquo;t know how to do the same thing for
heroku. Based on the messages during deployment, the problem seems like it
originates from my <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file. I originally started working on the app in
a Windows environment, migrating it to a virtual machine through Vagrant, and
then to an Ubuntu laptop now. Heroku had to redo <code>bundle install</code> after each
deployment because of the fact that it doesn&rsquo;t use the <code>Gemfile.lock</code> file due to the
Windows line endings.</p>

<p>I deleted that file and reran
<code>bundle install</code>. Also, since the <a href="https://github.com/zbruhnke/bloggy">bloggy gem</a>
was throwing the error and I was already planning to remove it in the future, I decided
to uninstall it as well. I&rsquo;m aiming to add a different blogging engine or a basic
Rails one so that the layouts would not be separate from the Rails app. This way,
I would be able to write unit tests for it in the future. Jekyll is a static site generator and I
don&rsquo;t know how to create a proper test for it besides making sure that
<code>jekyll build</code> wasn&rsquo;t throwing any errors. Afterwards,
<code>heroku run rake db:migrate</code> was successful and the app was running again.</p>

would automatically spy on all methods without having to stub it out. The main
issue is that stubbing is usually a good indicator of the class&rsquo;s design. You
should&rsquo;t have to stub multiple methods to pass a test for classes that are designed

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started learning about coding, I was reading through Zed Shaw&rsquo;s
<a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">book</a> about Python. The very first program I
made was based on the text game in one of the <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex31.html">exercises</a>. It was
a game that would give me suggestions or try to motivate me in some way based on
how I answered questions. It was a really bad example of programming with
many nested <code>if..else</code> statements, but I believe that working through that game
was ultimately the reason why I kept trying to learn. Unfortunately, I lost that
game when my computer was stolen. Which brings me to the first thing I should
have gotten when I started, a way to backup my files.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com">Github</a> is the most popular
choice from but I was always afraid to show really bad code or
accidently sharing something personal like passwords or api keys. That&rsquo;s the reason that I
put off starting one for a long time. I became more diligent about backups after losing all the tutorial applications
and links that I was saving. Around that time, I created an account at <a href="http://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a> because it allowed free
private repositories and it helped me get started using <a href="http://gitref.org/">git</a>
commands. Starting with Github first would have helped me get over the hump about
sharing or talking with other programmers but if that barrier is too big at the
moment, it&rsquo;s better to go with the alternative than not at all.</p>

<p>Another thing I should have started from the beginning was working through an
app from <code>rails new appname</code> to deploying it. I put off this part for awhile
and it was a huge detriment later on. Personally, my fear of
deploying a demo was similar to my fear of the command line in the
beginning. A major part of that was connecting and using a Database that wasn&rsquo;t
<a href="https://sqlite.org/">sqlite</a> along with the other configurations.
I knew enough about SQL and databases in general
to work with it in a Rails app but that was different from having
to configure it outside a development environment. For demos and trying to deploy the first time, <a href="http://heroku.com">heroku</a>
is my number one choice because it was the most painless for me, the most that I
had to do was extract out some keys to environment variables and add a
different Ruby server besides WEBrick. Their articles
guided me on how to deploy for the first time and the reasons why they require
programs to be deployed in that way.</p>

<p>The last thing I focused on in the beginning was that I put a lot of time doing
exercises like <a href="http://rubykoans.com/">ruby koans</a> and <a href="http://exercism.io/">exercism</a>
because it abstracted out a lot of parts that I couldn&rsquo;t get my head around yet.
I only found these exercises through GitHub and in the latter&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s the
only way to access the exercises and let other users comment on your work.
I was ignorant to the design patterns other people were using since I was so
focused on just making the tests pass, but I used them to become familiar with the
syntax and the way Ruby solved problems. Aiming to work on one problem a day was
an attainable enough goal to create a habit and eventually fall in love with the
process. As an added benefit, those exercises
gave me a great appreciation of testing in general because that was the only way
I knew if I was doing the right things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been taking an <a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/">email course</a> by
<a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com">John Somez</a> on blogging and it has been a great
way to refocus on the possible content for this site. One of the first suggestions I
ever heard about learning how to program was that I should blog as much as possible, but
I kept struggling with deciding what I should write about and being consistent with it.</p>

<h2>Choosing a theme</h2>

<p>When I started exploring web development and programming, there were so many choices and
possible paths that I became hesitant and afraid to make the wrong decision. I tried a
little bit of everything because of that fear. I would try all the beginner courses on Treehouse
covering JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Ruby when I should have stuck with one.
Choosing a theme reminded me of that indecisiveness. It eventually came down to
writing about something I&rsquo;m familiar with (Ruby on Rails) or something that I need to learn more about (JavaScript frameworks).
I eventually decided to write about Ruby because its the topic I&rsquo;m most
confident in and a language I really enjoy using. I also believe that there is a big jump between
introductory tutorials on Rails and intermediate level stuff that I could help
fill with my blog posts. If I&rsquo;m able to, I want to incorporate a magic theme because
I always hear about the magic that goes in the background of a Rails
application. One of my favorite Ruby books, called Metaprogramming Ruby 2,
had a section called spell book that prompted me to record and study design patterns or quirky
Ruby behavior in notebooks as if I was writing my own Ruby spellbooks. While
learning on my own, little motivations like that can sometimes help the most and
it&rsquo;s a fun way to think about programming.</p>

<h2>Creating the blog</h2>

<p>I had already created this blog by forking a pre-made <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">jekyll
repo</a>, following its instructions
and reading an <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">article</a> on setting it up.
I was able to host it on my account&rsquo;s <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github page</a>
and the repo itself included plugins for disqus and most common social media accounts.
I read a blog post about the <a href="http://www.digital-results.com/static-site-generators/">advantages</a>
of a static site generators and since <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> was written in Ruby, I was more inclined
to use it as a blogging platform instead of Wordpress. I&rsquo;m aiming to improve the
styling for this blog in the future or even migrate it to a <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> project since that one more
closely resembles a Rails app.</p>

<h2>Blog post ideas</h2>

<p>When I was struggling to come up with blog post ideas
before this course, I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think of sitting down and brainstorming 30 to 50 ideas at once. It
seems obvious now and I can definitely see it helping in a lot of ways.
I can start writing drafts days before I need to publish them or
even create drafts for other posts. This will enable me to check my work and
add more relevant details that come up after multiple proofreadings. This reduces the fear
I have with putting my writing out there and would encourage more creative ideas. Also, I
came up with a lot of things I wish I knew when I started and those
are the blog posts I want to write first.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>Consistency might be the most difficult part of writing a blog. Staying consistent and
forming good habits is very important because if I can&rsquo;t be disciplined enough to write
regularly, why should the readers care about following my posts? I want to
publish as much as I can to show and share how much I&rsquo;ve learned, become better
as a writer, and get called out if I don&rsquo;t fully understand what I&rsquo;m
talking about. In a way, writing without comments or feedback is like coding
without tests, you won&rsquo;t really know if what you&rsquo;re doing is wrong until a bigger problem
occurs down the road.</p>

<h2>Web traffic</h2>

<p>This is another tough one. There are so many blogs out there and standing out
will take a lot of time and effort. It involves following other
people&rsquo;s blogs, commenting with relevant information, and providing value in
some way. I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to engage with the comments section for blogs
that I follow and trusting myself enough to voice an opinion, but everything is
always a work in progress. Writing more blog posts would probably help in that
department too.</p>
