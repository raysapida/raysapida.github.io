<div class="entry-content"><p>For the past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been taking an <a href="http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/">email course</a> by
<a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com">John Somez</a> on blogging and it has been a great
way to refocus on the possible content for this site. One of the first suggestions I
ever heard about learning how to program was that I should blog as much as possible, but
I kept struggling with deciding what I should write about and being consistent with it.</p>

<h2>Choosing a theme</h2>

<p>When I started exploring web development and programming, there were so many choices and
possible paths that I became hesitant and afraid to make the wrong decision. I tried a
little bit of everything because of that fear. I would try all the beginner courses on Treehouse
covering JavaScript, Python, PHP, and Ruby when I should have stuck with one.
Choosing a theme reminded me of that indecisiveness. It eventually came down to
writing about something I&rsquo;m familiar with (Ruby on Rails) or something that I need to learn more about (JavaScript frameworks).
I eventually decided to write about Ruby because its the topic I&rsquo;m most
confident in and a language I really enjoy using. I also believe that there is a big jump between
introductory tutorials on Rails and intermediate level stuff that I could help
fill with my blog posts. If I&rsquo;m able to, I want to incorporate a magic theme because
I always hear about the magic that goes in the background of a Rails
application. One of my favorite Ruby books, called Metaprogramming Ruby 2,
had a section called spell book that prompted me to record and study design patterns or quirky
Ruby behavior in notebooks as if I was writing my own Ruby spellbooks. While
learning on my own, little motivations like that can sometimes help the most and
it&rsquo;s a fun way to think about programming.</p>

<h2>Creating the blog</h2>

<p>I had already created this blog by forking a pre-made <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">jekyll
repo</a>, following its instructions
and reading an <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">article</a> on setting it up.
I was able to host it on my account&rsquo;s <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github page</a>
and the repo itself included plugins for disqus and most common social media accounts.
I read a blog post about the <a href="http://www.digital-results.com/static-site-generators/">advantages</a>
of a static site generators and since <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> was written in Ruby, I was more inclined
to use it as a blogging platform instead of Wordpress. I&rsquo;m aiming to improve the
styling for this blog in the future or even migrate it to a <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> project since that one more
closely resembles a Rails app.</p>

<h2>Blog post ideas</h2>

<p>When I was struggling to come up with blog post ideas
before this course, I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t think of sitting down and brainstorming 30 to 50 ideas at once. It
seems obvious now and I can definitely see it helping in a lot of ways.
I can start writing drafts days before I need to publish them or
even create drafts for other posts. This will enable me to check my work and
add more relevant details that come up after multiple proofreadings. This reduces the fear
I have with putting my writing out there and would encourage more creative ideas. Also, I
came up with a lot of things I wish I knew when I started and those
are the blog posts I want to write first.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>

<p>Consistency might be the most difficult part of writing a blog. Staying consistent and
forming good habits is very important because if I can&rsquo;t be disciplined enough to write
regularly, why should the readers care about following my posts? I want to
publish as much as I can to show and share how much I&rsquo;ve learned, become better
as a writer, and get called out if I don&rsquo;t fully understand what I&rsquo;m
talking about. In a way, writing without comments or feedback is like coding
without tests, you won&rsquo;t really know if what you&rsquo;re doing is wrong until a bigger problem
occurs down the road.</p>

<h2>Web traffic</h2>

<p>This is another tough one. There are so many blogs out there and standing out
will take a lot of time and effort. It involves following other
people&rsquo;s blogs, commenting with relevant information, and providing value in
some way. I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to engage with the comments section for blogs
that I follow and trusting myself enough to voice an opinion, but everything is
always a work in progress. Writing more blog posts would probably help in that
department too.</p>
