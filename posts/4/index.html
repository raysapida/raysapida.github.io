  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working through the testing trails in upcase for test doubles and
testing fundamentals. The most difficult part for me was understanding mocks and spies along with how to
structure them to make sure the right behavior is being tested. I&rsquo;ve
written unit tests and a few acceptance tests in the past but I&rsquo;ve never used
test doubles before the upcase trail. I had to research the differences between
fakes, dummies, stubs, spies and mocks. Upcase provided an
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">aricle</a> by Martin Fowler as
an introduction to those ideas. From my understanding, the advantages
of using test doubles are clarity and speed. The unit tests should already tests
that the proper answers are being given in the model or controller level which
makes stubs a good way to improve them. Mocks ensure that specific method calls
are being used and spies take that a step further by recording how the method
calls are used. For example, spies could say that a method call was used twice
instead of the expected once.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned the definitions for different kinds of testing; unit,
integration, feature, and functional tests. Unit tests are for a small subset of the
application and I closely associate it with tests for a specific controller or
model. Integration tests go from end to end and I&rsquo;ve used it to test that
logging in to an application or using the user interface. Functional tests are
integration tests that actually run the application from end to end similar to
making sure that an email is sent when a person is trying to recover a forgotten
password. Feature tests are for things that change the functionality of the
application like changing a status update from text only to including image
attachments.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also still getting used to rspec and capybara. The most prevalent comments I would receive from the
exercises were the different shortcuts people use in their tests and other
improvements on readability to make sure that the reader can better understand
the intent behind the tests. Most of my
tests in the past was using Minitest because it was included by default and
it was the framework most of the tutorials I followed use; it&rsquo;s the testing framework included with the exercism
exercises and the Treehouse tutorials for the Treebook application. I&rsquo;ve never
really thought of tests outside unit testing but I&rsquo;m appreciating what testing
adds to the application. I&rsquo;m starting to see why tests can function as
documentation instead of comments and how bugs can be recreated to better
understand where edge cases are coming from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent most of January working on exercism challenges and refamiliarizing myself with Rails. I haven&rsquo;t been able to pair program with other people yet and online
exercises have been the only way I&rsquo;ve gotten feedback for the programs I&rsquo;ve written. It&rsquo;s been a good way to learn more about design patterns and subtleties in the Ruby language. Out of all the exercises there, I enjoyed the one about Binary Search Trees the most. Another user on the site turned me towards using the Null Object Pattern and my research into the topic led me to an <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/05/30/null-objects-and-falsiness/">article</a> that illustrated how it could be used in Ruby. In the end, I ended up with code that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Bst
  attr_accessor :left, :right, :data

  def initialize(data)
    @data = data
    @left = NullObject.new
    @right = NullObject.new
  end

  def insert(number)
    if number &gt; @data
      in_right(number)
    elsif number &lt;= @data
      in_left(number)
    end
  end

  def each(&amp;block)
    left.each(&amp;block)
    block.call(data)
    right.each(&amp;block)
  end

  private

  def in_right(number)
    right.insert(number) or @right = Bst.new(number)
  end

  def in_left(number)
    left.insert(number) or @left = Bst.new(number)
  end
end
class NullObject
  def data
    nil
  end

  def insert(*)
    false
  end

  def each(*)
    self
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The exercism website also had challenges that involved other data structures
like linked lists and matrices. I&rsquo;ve been reading more and more about how to
become job ready as a programmer and there have been a lot of advice on being
familiar with common data structures and how to implement them as well as
recognizing the <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">Big-O</a> complexities of different algorithms. I&rsquo;ve mostly been teaching
myself and I know that I need to spend time on subjects that other programmers
would have been exposed to in school. I want to do my best to expose my
ignorance now.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve also started a membership at <a href="upcase.com">upcase</a> so that I could become
more familiar with the tools that Ruby on Rails developers use. I&rsquo;ve learned
more about how to use vim and testing use rspec/capybara. I&rsquo;m amazed by how
efficient I could be using while vim and how easy it could be to learn when I&rsquo;m
pointed in the right direction. I&rsquo;ve neglected how to write my own tests in the
past and I&rsquo;m trying to remedy that by learning how to use the tools other
developers employ. Currently, I&rsquo;m also trying to learn how to use tmux in one of
upcase&rsquo;s new trails.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started learning more and more about Rails, I became very aware that my programming skills in Ruby was lacking. I would read the code examples and I would find many methods and concepts that I repeatedly had to look up online in order to understand. I started to panic a little bit then because I was afraid that what I was doing wasn&rsquo;t working and that I wasn&rsquo;t internalizing what I was learning.  A lot of times I feel like I&rsquo;m fumbling around trying to find a way to reach out and find something to hold on to and effectively learn. The main way I&rsquo;ve been doing this is through code challenges and tutorials but I&rsquo;ve been finding that there is a huge gap between the code that I was writing and the code that I would read on open source projects.</p>

<p>Because of that gap, I&rsquo;ve been reading as many Ruby Books as I can. This past month, I&rsquo;ve gone through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360">Learn to Program</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692">Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-Ruby-Program-Like-Facets/dp/1941222129">Metaprogramming Ruby 2: Program Like the Ruby Pros</a> and I&rsquo;m also halfway through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104">Eloquent Ruby</a>. These four books had a lot of intersections and they were a great starting point for the techniques that I was coming across while trying to read open source code. Along with those books, I&rsquo;ve also read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X">Secrets of the Javascript Ninja</a> so that I could learn more about the Web API/DOM and how Javascript fits into that picture. A lot of the tutorials I&rsquo;ve been finding uses Javascript extensively and my lack of understanding in that subject was becoming a bigger problem.</p>

<p>Because of these issues, I decided that December was the month that I would hunker down and challenge these glaring holes in my understanding. I dove deeper into Ruby and Javascript than I have before and ensured that I knew as much as I could before I buried myself even more into the various frameworks I was running across. Most of this renewed enthusiasm towards the language instead of the framework was because I was hearing over and over again about people learning frameworks without knowing what problems those frameworks were trying to solve.</p>

<p>In my head, I have a clearer picture of Ruby&rsquo;s object model and order for it&rsquo;s method lookup. I have a clearer idea of how an object inherits it&rsquo;s methods and how monkeypatching works. I&rsquo;ve learned more about the techniques Rubyist use in their code including <code>method_missing</code> and the <code>eval</code> family to create scopes or get around them. I&rsquo;ve gone through them too quickly to fully understand their importance but I&rsquo;m going to use what I&rsquo;ve learned to understand the open source projects that I&rsquo;m using.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m finally sitting down and trying to look into the questions that built up from the past week</p>

<ul>
<li><h3>Why adding the ruby gem foreman into the Gemfile is not recommended?</h3>

<p>This ruby gem is used for organizing apps with multiple components and uses a Procfile. The Procfile lists which processes foreman is suppose to manage. Heroku has an <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile#process-types-as-templates">article</a> that provides further details on Procfiles and the github page for foreman also has an extensive <a href="http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/">manual</a>. What jumped out the most from the foreman manual were the flags for port and concurrency which managed how many workers would be used for each process. From the heroku article , the most basic command in the Procfile was <code>bundle exec rails server -p $PORT</code> but more processes can be added. From what I can find, Heroku didn&rsquo;t suggest adding foreman into the Gemfile because its already added by default.</p></li>
<li><h3>How does Unicorn interact with Rack Applications ?</h3>

<p>I found an <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2010/everything-you-need-to-know-about-unicorn">article</a> that clarified the features that Unicorn has. There was also another article on how they can be configured at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-optimize-unicorn-workers-in-a-ruby-on-rails-app">Digitial Ocean</a>. Both articles wrote about the advantages of using Unicorn but I didn&rsquo;t start seeing how it could be implemented until I looked at the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/initialization.html#loading-rails-rack-lib-rack-server-rb">guide</a> for the Rails Initialization Process. At the end of the guide, it mentioned that the process would be handed off to the specific server implementaion and that led me to the <a href="http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/tree/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb">Unicorn::HttpServer</a> class. I&rsquo;m not sure how the process goes after it reaches this point, but I&rsquo;ll read the source code more in detail to find out. I do know from the comments that a server could be run using <code>HttpServer::run</code>. In the future, I want to write a blog post that extends the guide to how Unicorn would handle the last line <code>server.run wrapped_app, options, &amp;blk</code>.</p></li>
<li><h3>What are the major differences between Unicorn, Thin , Puma and other Rack web servers ?</h3>

<p>This <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/a-comparison-of-rack-web-servers-for-ruby-web-applications">article</a> was a great start on figuring out the differences between the servers. The answer produced even more questions though. Specifically on what is NGINX, Mongrel&rsquo;s parser, Event Machine network I/O library, and the specifics of Rack middleware for HTTP requests.</p></li>
<li><h3>How does concurrency and thread-safe work in a Rails?</h3>

<p>I started looking at stackoverflow to find out what <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/concurrency-vs-parallelism-what-is-the-difference">concurrency</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/261683/what-is-meant-by-thread-safe-code">thread-safe</a> means. There was also another <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15184338/how-to-know-what-is-not-thread-safe-in-ruby">post</a> on what isn&rsquo;t thread safe in Ruby. Rails has a specific <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/config-threadsafe/">configuration</a> that is turned on by default and this <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/06/18/removing-config-threadsafe.html">post</a> went into through an indepth discussion about what that configuration did. The most interesting parts was when he said that &ldquo;We know that loading the framework isn’t threadsafe, so the strategy is to load it all up before any threads are ready to handle requests&rdquo; and that the <code>@allow_concurrency</code> option turns off a Rack Middleware called <code>Rack::Lock</code>. Again, this opened up more questions about the difference between multi-threaded servers and multi-process servers along with the difference between eager loading and lazy loading.</p>

<pre><code>  def threadsafe!
      @preload_frameworks = true
      @cache_classes      = true
      @dependency_loading = false
      @allow_concurrency  = true
      self
  end
</code></pre></li>
<li><h3>How to configure a deployment through environment variables?</h3>

<p>After finding two articles about it from <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html">railsapps</a> and <a href="http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/managing-environment-configuration-variables-in-rails">tealeaf</a>, the best ways I read to manage environment variables centers around two gems; <a href="https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro">figaro</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv-deployment">dotenv-development</a>. Both use a separate file, <code>.env</code> and <code>application.yml</code> respectively, that can be used to set environment variables and should not added to the public repository.</p></li>
<li><h3>What are the best practices for deploying a Rails application?</h3>

<p>There were many articles about this and I found that the best practices revolve around where you&rsquo;re deploying to and the specific requirements for your app. A common thread I found was using a tool to standardize the process like <a href="http://capistranorb.com/documentation/overview/what-is-capistrano/">capistrano</a>, <a href="https://www.getchef.com/chef/">chef</a>, or <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">puppet</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

      <p class="meta">
        




<time class='entry-date' datetime='2014-11-29T00:00:00-08:00'><span class='date'><span class='date-month'>Nov</span> <span class='date-day'>29</span><span class='date-suffix'>th</span>, <span class='date-year'>2014</span></span> <span class='time'>12:00 am</span></time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was researching the ideas behind the 12 factor app and I learned a lot about deploying an application.</p>

<ol>
<li><h3>Codebase</h3>

<p>The main idea behind this factor is using a version control system and that one app corresponds to one codebase. Codebases should not share code and if it does, they should be refactored into a shared library that can be included with dependencies.</p></li>
<li><h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>Manage dependencies within an app and for a Rails application, this can be done through the Gemfile with locked versions.</p></li>
<li><h3>Config</h3>

<p>The configuration should be separate from the code and preferrably set in the environment&rsquo;s variables. For a Rails app, there&rsquo;s an explicit directory where configurations can be defined but this definition does not include routes or other internal configurations. Does this mean that the configurations in the yaml files should not be stated? This <a href="http://blog.doismellburning.co.uk/2014/10/06/twelve-factor-config-misunderstandings-and-advice/">article</a> cleared up some of those things for me. Things like the secret key and database configuration can be managed from the command line or with a <code>config/secrets.yml</code> that&rsquo;s not added to a repository. I still had more questions about managing secret keys outside of Rails with engines like Devise. I searched more and found answers in <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/issues/2554">one</a> of Devise&rsquo;s issues page. I still need to do more research into this because it sounds specific to what an app is using.</p></li>
<li><h3>Backing Services</h3>

<p>These services include the database, messaging and cache systems. The main idea behind this is that each service should be loosely coupled with the app and that would enable a deployment to easily swap them. My only experience with this so far is through database configurations.</p></li>
<li><h3>Build, Release, Run</h3>

<p>This factor encourages the separation betweem the build, release, and run stages. The build stage occurs during deployment, the release stage combines the build stage with configurations, and the run stage occurs while the environment is proccessing requests. I&rsquo;m still figuring out the best way to do this for a Rails app. Most of the articles I&rsquo;ve read used scripts to simplify these stages.</p></li>
<li><h3>Processes</h3>

<p>Each process should be stateless, share nothing with each other, and persistent data should be stored in a database. Specifically, the state is transfered in requests and not stored in the web server. From my understanding, these states don&rsquo;t apply to sessions which are stored in clients as cookies. This concept seems to go in line with a REST applications and helps with scaling the application.</p></li>
<li><h3>Port Binding</h3>

<p>The app should be self-contained and should not depend on runtime execution. It listens to requests and sends data through the port bindings. Along with processes, this one seems to be similar to a REST application and Rails can usually do this for free.</p></li>
<li><h3>Concurrency</h3>

<p>The application should be thread-safe or support concurrency meaning multiple processes could be added. I&rsquo;m still struggling with the idea of what kind of code is thread-safe in Rails and how Rails implements concurrency. I&rsquo;ve read that Rails uses concurrency by making sure that threads don&rsquo;t share the same data when they&rsquo;re run or lock them when they do to reduce interference but I don&rsquo;t know where this happens in the framework.</p></li>
<li><h3>Disposability</h3>

<p>Apps should have a fast startup and graceful shutdown. The former implies that less data or processes would be needed for the application to start and the latter implies that the app won&rsquo;t need a specific process every time it shuts down. Both parts make concurrent requests more effective and durable from errors. Specific implementations of this would include blocking a new request if the older one is still going or reconnecting  when the connection is lost.</p></li>
<li><h3>Dev/prod parity</h3>

<p>This involves keeping development and production as similar as possible. This helps with continuous deployment by keeping changes small so they can be pushed to development quickly, having developers work on both stages, and keeping the tools/dependencies as similar as possible. For example, the development side should use the same type of database and the environment could be handled by a virtual machine through vagrant to make sure that everything works on the same machine.</p></li>
<li><h3>Logs</h3>

<p>Treating logs as an event stream enables them to be stored in a third party service instead of a specific log file. This is useful when the app is deployed to multiple places and all the logs would be handle by one service.</p></li>
<li><h3>Admin Processes</h3>

<p>Administration processes like migrations should be handled as a one off process and in an identical environment as production. This is usually done through deployment scripts. I&rsquo;m still learning how to deploy an app effectively so this one is still a work in progress.</p></li>
