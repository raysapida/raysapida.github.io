  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Basic Commands</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/ls.html">ls</a> command list the contents of the current directory. A more detailed
  form would be <code>ls -la</code> which lists the contents along with their file permissions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/cd.html">cd</a> command lets you move back and forth from folders by adding the
  folder name afterwards. <code>cd ..</code> lets you move back by one folder and <code>cd -</code>
lets you jump back and forth between the last changed spots.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/mkdir.html">mkdir</a> command makes a folder while <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/rmdir.html">rmdir</a> removes an empty folder.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/cp.html">cp</a> can copy files where the the first group is the target and the second
  group is the destination.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/mv.html">mv</a> moves files and works similarly to <code>cp</code> except the first group is
  deleted afterwards.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/rm.html">rm</a> command deletes a file and passing in additional flags like <code>rm
  -rf</code> would delete a whole folder along with its contents.</p>

<h2>Useful Commands</h2>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/man.html">man</a> followed by another command would show the complete help
  section on how to use that command. Whenever I&rsquo;m lost or forgot how to use a
particular command, I would use this to figure out how it works.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/sudo.html">sudo</a> can be prepended to other commands that need super user
  permission to execute.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/chmod.html">chmod</a> can change the file permissions of a file enabling you to edit or use
  thE FIle.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/grep.html">grep</a> lets you search through the file&rsquo;s or output&rsquo;s contents using a regular
  expression. There are other commands that other people use to perform the same
function but this is the most common one.</p>

<p><a href="http://ss64.com/bash/head.html">head</a> and <a href="http://ss64.com/bash/tail.html">tail</a> - Shows the first of last ten lines for a file or output.
  They&rsquo;re useful for logs and when piping a string of commands.</p>

<p><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html">rails</a> has their own set of
  commands along with
<a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#running-migrations">rake</a> commands for migrations. I end up using <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-console">rails
console</a> the most
when debugging a problem or exploring an application.</p>

<h2>Optional Commands</h2>

<p><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/up.html">vagrant up</a> and <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/cli/ssh.html">vagrant ssh</a> - I had a lot of trouble with setting up a development environment since I had a Windows 8 laptop. I
learned that <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> was the easiest way to start
using a virtual machine at the time and I started with the <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box">rails dev box</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/cli">rvm</a> was how I managed my environments and it helped
  me separate incompatible gems. A Gemfile should manage most of
these but I had trouble figuring out where errors were coming from when
installing gems and this was an easier solution at the time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.viemu.com/a_vi_vim_graphical_cheat_sheet_tutorial.html">vim</a> - I started with vim because I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to share
  folders between the virtual machine and the local machine but I ended up
enjoying being able to quickly switch between the editor and shell so much that I stuck
with it.</p>

<p><a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course">tmux</a> - I began learning this on an Upcase trail and using it finally
  convinced me to install a Linux distribution. It became more evident that developing in a virtual
machine was the bottleneck for me when I became comfortable
enough in a tmux session, especially when running tests.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was getting deeper into reading <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/achbd/the-rspec-book">The Rspec
Book</a> a few weeks ago, I found
that I had difficulties when it came to information that wasn&rsquo;t included in the
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">rails guides</a>. I picked up <a href="https://leanpub.com/tr4w">The Rails 4
Way</a> to rectify that. The book felt more like
documentation while I was reading it and that&rsquo;s very intentional. The breadth and
depth was impressive and I wanted to get a book that I could carry with me as a
physical documentation of the framework. I knew before reading it that I
couldn&rsquo;t memorize everything the book had to offer so I read it like I would
when I read Google Map directions, finding the general routes I needed and
making a mental note for things that I didn&rsquo;t need to know now but would
definitely look into once I reached that landmark.</p>

<p>The first chapter dealt with a rails environment and configuration. Most of it
dealt with things I learned from other sources but I was introduced into the
specifics of bundler and other configuration details. This is the section I
learned to add gems into the vendor directory which I wanted to do because I
recently learned about ctags from Upcase&rsquo;s vim trail. This enabled me to jump
around my app figuring out how methods are called throughout the application.
The next three chapters after that were also refreshers on routes, REST in
Rails, and controllers.</p>

<p>There were five full chapters that dealt with active record split into general
active record uses, migrations, associations, validations and advance active
record uses. Active record deals with so many parts of Rails that I remember looking at the
source code before and not getting where to begin. The book delved into the
database adapters for the most common relational databases and how Rails
interprets the types of data they use. During the rest of the chapters, what
stood out to me the most where how callback were used in the model, how
associations are made particularly polymorphic associations, and using indexes.</p>

<p>The tenth chapter dealt with the action view part of Rails and introduced the
decent exposure gem. Most of it was a refresher dealing with methods available
in the view diretory, using partials, and rendering objects or collections. The
most useful part I learned was the <code>assigns</code> instance variable which shows what
is being communicated between the controller and view.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working through the testing trails in upcase for test doubles and
testing fundamentals. The most difficult part for me was understanding mocks and spies along with how to
structure them to make sure the right behavior is being tested. I&rsquo;ve
written unit tests and a few acceptance tests in the past but I&rsquo;ve never used
test doubles before the upcase trail. I had to research the differences between
fakes, dummies, stubs, spies and mocks. Upcase provided an
<a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">aricle</a> by Martin Fowler as
an introduction to those ideas. From my understanding, the advantages
of using test doubles are clarity and speed. The unit tests should already tests
that the proper answers are being given in the model or controller level which
makes stubs a good way to improve them. Mocks ensure that specific method calls
are being used and spies take that a step further by recording how the method
calls are used. For example, spies could say that a method call was used twice
instead of the expected once.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned the definitions for different kinds of testing; unit,
integration, feature, and functional tests. Unit tests are for a small subset of the
application and I closely associate it with tests for a specific controller or
model. Integration tests go from end to end and I&rsquo;ve used it to test that
logging in to an application or using the user interface. Functional tests are
integration tests that actually run the application from end to end similar to
making sure that an email is sent when a person is trying to recover a forgotten
password. Feature tests are for things that change the functionality of the
application like changing a status update from text only to including image
attachments.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also still getting used to rspec and capybara. The most prevalent comments I would receive from the
exercises were the different shortcuts people use in their tests and other
improvements on readability to make sure that the reader can better understand
the intent behind the tests. Most of my
tests in the past was using Minitest because it was included by default and
it was the framework most of the tutorials I followed use; it&rsquo;s the testing framework included with the exercism
exercises and the Treehouse tutorials for the Treebook application. I&rsquo;ve never
really thought of tests outside unit testing but I&rsquo;m appreciating what testing
adds to the application. I&rsquo;m starting to see why tests can function as
documentation instead of comments and how bugs can be recreated to better
understand where edge cases are coming from.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I spent most of January working on exercism challenges and refamiliarizing myself with Rails. I haven&rsquo;t been able to pair program with other people yet and online
exercises have been the only way I&rsquo;ve gotten feedback for the programs I&rsquo;ve written. It&rsquo;s been a good way to learn more about design patterns and subtleties in the Ruby language. Out of all the exercises there, I enjoyed the one about Binary Search Trees the most. Another user on the site turned me towards using the Null Object Pattern and my research into the topic led me to an <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/05/30/null-objects-and-falsiness/">article</a> that illustrated how it could be used in Ruby. In the end, I ended up with code that looked like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class Bst
  attr_accessor :left, :right, :data

  def initialize(data)
    @data = data
    @left = NullObject.new
    @right = NullObject.new
  end

  def insert(number)
    if number &gt; @data
      in_right(number)
    elsif number &lt;= @data
      in_left(number)
    end
  end

  def each(&amp;block)
    left.each(&amp;block)
    block.call(data)
    right.each(&amp;block)
  end

  private

  def in_right(number)
    right.insert(number) or @right = Bst.new(number)
  end

  def in_left(number)
    left.insert(number) or @left = Bst.new(number)
  end
end
class NullObject
  def data
    nil
  end

  def insert(*)
    false
  end

  def each(*)
    self
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The exercism website also had challenges that involved other data structures
like linked lists and matrices. I&rsquo;ve been reading more and more about how to
become job ready as a programmer and there have been a lot of advice on being
familiar with common data structures and how to implement them as well as
recognizing the <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">Big-O</a> complexities of different algorithms. I&rsquo;ve mostly been teaching
myself and I know that I need to spend time on subjects that other programmers
would have been exposed to in school. I want to do my best to expose my
ignorance now.</p>

<p> I&rsquo;ve also started a membership at <a href="upcase.com">upcase</a> so that I could become
more familiar with the tools that Ruby on Rails developers use. I&rsquo;ve learned
more about how to use vim and testing use rspec/capybara. I&rsquo;m amazed by how
efficient I could be using while vim and how easy it could be to learn when I&rsquo;m
pointed in the right direction. I&rsquo;ve neglected how to write my own tests in the
past and I&rsquo;m trying to remedy that by learning how to use the tools other
developers employ. Currently, I&rsquo;m also trying to learn how to use tmux in one of
upcase&rsquo;s new trails.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I started learning more and more about Rails, I became very aware that my programming skills in Ruby was lacking. I would read the code examples and I would find many methods and concepts that I repeatedly had to look up online in order to understand. I started to panic a little bit then because I was afraid that what I was doing wasn&rsquo;t working and that I wasn&rsquo;t internalizing what I was learning.  A lot of times I feel like I&rsquo;m fumbling around trying to find a way to reach out and find something to hold on to and effectively learn. The main way I&rsquo;ve been doing this is through code challenges and tutorials but I&rsquo;ve been finding that there is a huge gap between the code that I was writing and the code that I would read on open source projects.</p>

<p>Because of that gap, I&rsquo;ve been reading as many Ruby Books as I can. This past month, I&rsquo;ve gone through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360">Learn to Program</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1617291692">Well-Grounded Rubyist</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metaprogramming-Ruby-Program-Like-Facets/dp/1941222129">Metaprogramming Ruby 2: Program Like the Ruby Pros</a> and I&rsquo;m also halfway through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321584104">Eloquent Ruby</a>. These four books had a lot of intersections and they were a great starting point for the techniques that I was coming across while trying to read open source code. Along with those books, I&rsquo;ve also read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X">Secrets of the Javascript Ninja</a> so that I could learn more about the Web API/DOM and how Javascript fits into that picture. A lot of the tutorials I&rsquo;ve been finding uses Javascript extensively and my lack of understanding in that subject was becoming a bigger problem.</p>

<p>Because of these issues, I decided that December was the month that I would hunker down and challenge these glaring holes in my understanding. I dove deeper into Ruby and Javascript than I have before and ensured that I knew as much as I could before I buried myself even more into the various frameworks I was running across. Most of this renewed enthusiasm towards the language instead of the framework was because I was hearing over and over again about people learning frameworks without knowing what problems those frameworks were trying to solve.</p>

<p>In my head, I have a clearer picture of Ruby&rsquo;s object model and order for it&rsquo;s method lookup. I have a clearer idea of how an object inherits it&rsquo;s methods and how monkeypatching works. I&rsquo;ve learned more about the techniques Rubyist use in their code including <code>method_missing</code> and the <code>eval</code> family to create scopes or get around them. I&rsquo;ve gone through them too quickly to fully understand their importance but I&rsquo;m going to use what I&rsquo;ve learned to understand the open source projects that I&rsquo;m using.</p>
